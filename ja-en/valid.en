Tourism Promotion Tax from April of 2019 = Japanese people, too, will contribute 1000 yen per person to the government and government party.
The Tourism Agency is completely missunderstanding ‚Äúthe reason why young people are not traveling abroad.‚Äù Well, it is in the near future for temporary workers and blue collar workers to cross the border to do an assignment for work.

Developer of programming language Ruby "I know well how the opposing party looks to make enemies of people like me who talk about our own skills and value flexibility.
A developer for Ruby, the programming language: "I'm a very skilled person that brags about my ability and as a person that wants a high level of discretion like myself, I understand very well that the opposition hates the very sight of me. It's really unfortunate." I thought that programmers must be smart but I guess that there are people that can't properly read a sentence.
It is because of that, the media is so distorted.‚Äù
It's an article of the thread title
This article denies the conspiracy theory, but in the end Japan's PTA is an "enormous organization that panders to the higher ups."
Buzz feed is just a summary article and the quality is too bad.
Such articles are sometimes talked about by politics.
In the article it says that Abenomics combating the poverty rate and improving the child poverty rate is due to a large increase in the number of people who are employed, but you are using all your effort to convince people that under the Democratic Party administration the poverty rate increasing is due to the increase in irregular employment.

Finance Minister Official: Rewrite 62 pages out of all 78 pages.

Sagawa, director of the National Tax Agency, is behind the false income tax returns. Summon him to the Diet at once! Arrest him, arrest him!
Tits are a status symbol.
Europe cannot solve its problem of increasing poverty through the 'basic income'.  In present day Japan, most shares in Japanese companies are held by the government, so even if no taxes are collected, internal reserves can be paid out as a claimed dividend, and this would be sufficient.  If this payment is made with money or with BI, then the left wing will come down on company favouritism.
Right wingers are fools who despite being in the poor class vote for the Liberal Democratic Party and dig their own graves, it's not like that's what they're saying.
If they are talking about the poor class then that includes themselves as well, so I was surprised at how they went out of their way to discriminate against themselves.
Even under the second Abe cabinet, in which the poverty rate improved, up until 2013 / 2014 regular employment decreased while irregular employment increased, you know?
I guess the old proverb that "Poverty dulls the wit" is true.

The CEO of a company that sold the 'Securiphone', which is equipped with a high security signal encryption function, has been arrested. 'There are a number of companies that sell 'securiphones', cell phones that boast of high security and encryption, but its has been reported that some of these companies have been selling the encrypted smartphone devices to drug rings and gangs.'    Neh, anyone who depends on these things must be pretty second rate LOL.  Those with true evil like me, rely solely on our own wits and sense of smell LOL.

TV shopping is the 'world's largest rental shop' where people practice 'wardrobing' by returning items after wearing them, and companies can't stop them.

Missile passage presumption. Subway stopped and evacuated in drill. Fukuoka. (NHK) Under the pretext of an international missile passing through outer space, a country that would stop a train and force the riders to wait against the wall, from the viewpoint of a third party it'd be easy to see that "That country's ruler is using fear to control the citizens", right? ??? "At this rate we'll have to lower the budget for next year... Well, good luck with road construction. Splashing the budget around on things like drills let's them avoid having the budget lowered for the next year." First off, drills against missiles are fundamentally meaningless, that's what I think. I bet that things like missile drills will continue to rise all over the country as budget countermeasures, so the local governments better get themselves ready.
I feel like they might take my money when I'm just passing by.

The Black faction of the movement. Compulsory participation is an infringement of students' freedom.

Departmental activity is no more.
Club activities go away ‚Üí Japan becomes a country of criminals and collapses. In a made up society like that there are only a few types of clubs, and there isn't much variation, and the students are under the impression that those are the only choices there are. I feel sorry for the kids who have limited choices among a wide variety of options.
Club activities stopping ‚Üí Japan becomes a country of criminals and collapses. Fukuzawa Shichiro said something like "If you are going to use your energy for war, you'll find it's much more sensible to spend it on sex." I just remembered that.

A popular state primary school within the Tokyo area.
Popular public middle school in the city. Chaos in the classroom of Obuchi Yuko's son. I can emulate a Jap brat's mind to a super high precision, so... Whenever there was homework with a kanji drill or an arithmetic drill it was "Hey, Obuchi kid, I don't want to do the homework, so can you dig a hole and get rid of it? Don't be so sneaky? Do it honestly?" Whenever there was an event like a school arts festival or athletic festival is was "Hey, Obuchi kid, today it's for real, right? This isn't a drill? Don't slack off. Do it honestly?" When it was break time it was "Hey, Obuchi penis, let's see your special moves. Let's see your penis drill." He was chased by everybody and his pants were forcibly pulled down, and thinking of that tough daily life being made to cry every day, the image pops into my mind. There are bullies out there who will bully a child for the mistakes or crimes of their parent, so the imagined scene above is not unthinkable. Bullies generally get indoctrinated by their parents (usually the mother). If you see bad behavior by a child it gives you a glimpse into the character of the parents.

Is that a serious consequence for the man? A four year sentence for repeated rape and pregnancy due to rape, transparency of men's sexism is obvious even in the judicial system, and their view on human rights is no different from the Islamic state which punishes rape victims as criminals. Corrective action must be taken against proactive discrimination and the breakdown of misogynistic practices in law, parliament, and the judiciary system is necessary. Criminal responsibility lies directly with the person who committed the crime. The rapist should be judged for rape just as a murderer is judged for murder. Are you aware that you are the same as a devil who does not recognize infants as human beings? If this was a murder victim, this woman was applauded if the father in law had raped her for several years.

At the welfare facility of the social welfare corporation where this Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly member serves as board chairman, the staff members made regular donations to him.

"If you were late with your donation, management would demand it from you." This went on for over 20 years, and a total of over 200 million yen was collected.

Investigation into "domestically manufacturing" super long range cruise missiles. Aiming to complete a prototype from 1964. Looking for power to destroy enemy bases. I guess they were probably thinking about a war with China, but if they dropped hydrogen bombs first and blew up the missile silos then it would all be over. At the time they didn't know if the US was an ally or not, so they were probably worried. If they go through the proper steps then I don't have any problem with it, but that crazy Abe acts rashly, so I am completely against it.

Pyeongchang Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.  It was Kim Yuna who lit the torch.  There were white tigers and bird masks.  Someone was carrying a giant smarphone while dancing.   OAR = Olympic Athlete from Russia. The Japanese clothes were fluorescent red, and the venue was filled with fluorescent colours. It was dazzling.  The Tongans were half naked even in the cold.  The North and South Korean teams entered the stadium together as Kim Yuna skated over to light the torch. The dance was like a Johnnies. Kuwako mistook it for the closing ceremony.

None of you seem interested, but around two days ago, this crappy song by an illustrator was all over the net.  Older brother Daisuke Yokoyama has apologised about 'Because I'm a mother'. We are in the middle of bringing up children, so why did that song make us so angry. One reason is because we would like a no.2 similar song 'because I'm a father.' But also because married couples start to think about all the free time they would have if children didn't arrive.\\n
I don't know if any of you care, but Daisuke Yamada issued an apology because of Nobumi, the the picture book author who caused controversy on the Internet two days ago over her horrible song lyrics, "Because I'm the mom". It's a song about a mother who depends on her children, you could even call it a song about toxic parenting. I hope it doesn't influence any thoughtless women who happen to hear it.

"That one wasn't good for me so introduce me to another woman. It takes a low class person to know a low class person. You are probably bad at sex too, right? Your poor boyfriend."

Isn't this out of order? I question the second day of the weekly holiday for public high school clubs.

It makes me want to say, "Is it the Japan High School Baseball Federation?"

Sankei had economic issues from the start, and there's worries that Yomiyuri might be crushed by the triangle with Nippon TV / Giants.

It is the prime minister's responsibility to remove any room for argument concerning the constitutionality of the Self Defense Force. As for things that might be unconstitutional, there are loads of others. There's also the issue of apportionment that the Supreme Court ruled to be unconstitutional. Ignoring those other topics and messing around with Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution is jumbling together the governmental organization and the dignity of the Self Defense Force, and it is just fancy talk putting idealism in place of constitutional theory.
Resposibility to get rid of possibility of Self Defense Force Unconstitution, it is Prime Minister's.  I think that it was not in the issue of elections, but what is the responsibility for? So, if you say your responsibility, are you disappearing if you  cannot find the way to resolve? It might be stupid to truly receive speaker's messange just listening to w

Oh yea, those who valiantly say "oh how irresponsible" and such are usually the ones who end up killing their parents because they can't handle taking care of them. It's usually men who kill their parents while taking care of them LOL.
1 out of every 20 high school students are taking care of their family, and can't go to school, aid is an issue. I don't understand. A problem is a problem and you can't say it was like this during my time so you need to do the same now. Your world view isn't related to this. Society doesn't care about how you gauge the world. It's too funny that you want others to fail because you're like that. It's like saying because working on the weekends without pay was the standard, everybody should do it now.

With an ageing society, cremation requirements are increasing. Local authorities bring in emergency measures.  If the fire is fierce then it should burn everything quickly... etc.This should be compacted enough to be able to say 'this is the Adam's apple' when gathering together the bones.  From my experience so far, the body is put in the coffin early in the morning, and carried to the crematorium in a small bus.  When it is finished, everyone moves to the hall or the home or the temple for the funeral service.  Is the body removed from the coffin afterwards?

The chinkotatsu È¥ÜÁÇ¨Ááµ(„Å°„Çì„Åì„Åü„Å§) is said to have been made in 1237 in the Southern Song dynasty of China, and is a variety of the kotatsu. The pleasant warmth was exclaimed to feel like being poisoned by a zhen or chin (a bird that is said to have poisonous feathers) and not being able to move from the kotatsu. Because of this, it was called a chinkotatsu, and became extremely popular with the public. In addition, the chinkotatsu promotes good circulation, (the theory original was that it was made for noble women who were sensitive to the cold) and for some reason it was said that it was especially good for male genitalia. It is also said that at the the battle of Fancheng in Xiangyang, which marked the beginning of the end for the Sun Song dynasty in China, that the method for making them was lost. Today, we don't know if that is actually true or not. From Minmei Publishing's "Observed Traditional Chinese Heater List"
