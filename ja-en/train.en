A complainer, Ms. Noriko, became enraged when she found out it only contained 98g in 100g Popcorn, and bought 100 bags of popcorn produced at the same factory and measured the weight I weighed 75g of yoghurt today but it only came to 73g I guess if I add the ones that are stuck on the cup or spoon, then it will be 75g  I realized it's such a waste that I can't ingest the exact displayed amount unless I licked inside the cup

Cute teenage girl "I've never been able to say this before, but I've always liked you minus20kg... I bet my sudden comment is bothersome to you... but... Ahh!! I accidentally sent it!!! Delete, delete... !!" I want to be teased.
Teenage youngster "nico videos are uncool, so I don't watch them". I thought from the start it wasn't really for people in that young of an age bracket. My impression is of otaku middle aged guys getting excited about them. Or, in the past was it cool? Hmm?
If you have 10B, give me 1B at least.
Let's bring 10B JPY together and have a look.

December 29, the New York Times used the first and eighth pages to publish the long article "She Broke Japan‚Äôs Silence on Rape". The article was about how the mainstream Japanese media turns a blind eye. We need to break down the silence regarding rape in Japan (NYT article translation). It is being broadcast online. People who only watch the mainstream media in Japan won't be reached even if the NYT reports on it. Is it even conceivable that a NYT broadcast could bring about a change to the mainstream Japanese media? Well, I guess it basically has no effect.

Tick that attacked dinosaurs one hundred million years ago discovered. Preserved in amber immediately after sucking blood. The first thing that comes to mind for dragons is Francis Drake, but I wonder if the nickname came from Spain... When I heard "Drake" I also remembered that there was a Saab Draken fighter plane, but this also is from the Swedish dragon "Mandrake" or "Mandragora". These types of words also have to do with dragons. How interesting.

2017 New Year's specials. NHK "Kouhaku". Nippon TV "Gaki no Tsukai". TV Tokyo "Kodoku No Gurume". This is just my opinion, but those who hold TV Tokyo in high regard seems to be the same people who like Kouhaku, so it might be a fierce competition. Ah, with the anime block I guess there's no support this year.

Apple corporation plans to integrate the iOS and Mac apps in 2018. It appears neither of them will work.  If it is based on the number of terminals on which the OS operates, it seems that it will be about 100 times different? Or even 1000 times?

These are interesting and I like them
There will be a 10 consecutive holidays for the new Emperor's accession in 2019... Government analysis.
When the new emperor ascends to the thrown in 2019, the government is going to look into changing the 10 day vacation. It is too long. Production and distribution suffer because of it. Consumers get (economically) hit in the head for half of a month. For the sake of the economy, three 3 day vacations would be better than one 10 day vacation.

The present situation and honest opinions of "women who marry early" at around 25 years old. | Is the satori generation going to save Japan? | Toyo Keizai Online. That's not early marriage. But fine women do all marriage at around this age. Those who are left over have some kind of reason.
The actual state, condition, and feelings of women before and after 25 years old who were married young. | Will the Satori generation save Japan? | Tokyo Keizai Online Aren't those the qualities that have been gradually passing for a desirable woman for the past 15 years? It's the image of getting married quickly and raising children well while working or being enrolled in a lab.
The conditions and motivations of "girls married young" around the age of 25 | Will the Satori Generation save Japan? | Toyo Keizai Online. They are unnecessary people, so maybe they don't know that a late marriage is recommended. At any rate the idea won't get through to them.
It's almost 25 but they're still doing magical girls  Uwaaaaa~~~ The current era's elementary school girls look ordinary but they're actually twice the age...

February 17th NewSokuR 3rd Anniversary. I bought Giant steps a few times and drank and compared them, but the flavor is so different I laughed LOL. Japan's packaging contains less (the price wasn't all that different) *What I bought are beans.

2chan "20 year old" terminology that has now disappeared, the "gods" that became entrenched, "You may go" "You too, huh"  The tone of 2ch (5ch) has changed so much, until recently it was the Hanshin Tigers dialect, now that's all obsolete and it's emojis and the like, that kind of feeling...
Current 2channel terminology in it's "20th year". "Go ahead and die" and "you too" have disappeared, "God" has become established. It's 5ch now, and from younger people these are old too. Even now on technical bulletin boards and minor bulletin boards there are people who "grow grass." People who were young when that terminology was popular might be using them on purpose.
Kids "memory card?" Some stupid thing like memo 2.
It was so funny that I put a little 2nd helping of milk into my coffee.
So she's in her 30s now.
Castration of an inferior over 30 year old penis.
Tower mansions on their way to becoming slums in 30 years, becoming a social issue. "Executive of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism" is apprehensive. If you're interested go to the Chisan Mansions in Nagoya. Apparently they're still going strong.
30 year old contract employee: "Gambling does not suit my personality so I bought 2 million yen on Coincheck". I think the point where you turn 2 million into 150 million is a great feat, but there's still a future ahead if you lose an actual 2 million. And there's still a possibility that you'll get a refund even if it's not all the money.
30 year old contract employee "Gambling doesn't really suit me, so I bought 2 million yen worth on coincheck." If it were about stocks being delisted then then it'd be a 99 win 1 loss losing pattern, but even if you predict a sudden crash it's always at a price sure to be profitable, and you couldn't have predicted the lock on the account, right?
30 year old contract employee "I'm not into gambling, so I put 2 million yen into coincheck". Yeah (jumping on the bandwagon). Just with a support line at the hand drawn level the high volatility can make for huge profits. By the way, is it true that there is a big commotion just because the Nikkei Stock Average moved by a few percent? If it were bitcoin then in an hour it'd fall, so it makes you laugh. And it is like that everyday.
The TV has almost 3.11 episodes, but you anticipated these and altered the report yesterday.
The 3/11 earthquake feels like it was ages ago. 9/11 and the Great Hanshin Earthquake do too. It's like a feeling of speechlessness when a lot of people die. It accumulates somewhere deep in your heart and stays there. It's like your legs aren't steady. Personally I think the 3/11 earthquake also played a part in strengthening the conservative feelings.

The results of a 34 year old woman going on a blind date with a male college student are too cringeworthy... <<Joshi SPA! It's a story about how the lady goes on a blind date to even out the numbers and ends up having sex with a kid. It's a story that wouldn't be exciting without Nagura.
The result of a 34 years old woman partying with university student guys is too painful...  ¬´ Girl SPA! Students only would be too modest. After stepping into the mid 20s, people start having there own obsessions, talking about work and income with each other, so they just can't party anymore.
Made from a 3D printer, a house built in 24 hours. The price is around one million yen, and it is great in terms of both cost and sense. Seems cold.
3D printed house that can be built in 24 hours. Price around 1,000,000 yen, good in terms of price and sensibility. I would worry about how well it does in earthquakes. Might be tough for Japan.
A house made in 24 hours with 3D Printers. It costs about 1 million yen, so the cost and the appearance are good. The video is awful.

Its a fine day.  Over 320 million yen in debt.  (Tokyo Engineering Research).  Officials who use money for networking, continue to be called 'way www', and not be taken seriously.
On a rather formal occasion, there was an insolvency of 320 million yen (Tokyo Commerce research).  I think it's a terrible story but I honestly don't care.  For those that are hurt by it I will talk and say, "that's terrible!" but honestly I don't care.

1960's Japan. Surprisingly, customs haven't changed.  "If everyone spent time in this way, war wouldn't happen"  "That's right, this kind of thing and other things..."  "What other things?"  "Uhh... It's that we eat breakfast together. Delicious breakfast."  "... (laugh)"  "Wake up in the morning, read the newspaper and go to work... Get married, have children and grow old together..."  "What kind of feeling is that, I wonder?"  "...I have no idea..."  I remembered a little
Japan in the 60s. It's surprising how little customs have changed. "If everybody lives like this then things like war won't occur." "Yeah, this sort of thing, or other things..." "Other things...?" "... Uh... Eating breakfast together. Delicious breakfast." "... (laughs)." "Get up in the morning, read the paper, then go to work... get married, have children, probably grow up along with them..." "I wonder what that's like." "... I have no idea..." I just thought back on it a bit.

PC sales have been increasing for the past 6 years.
Computers decrease for 6th consecutive year. Number of units exported reaches level from 10 years ago. As I've said, it's impossible to do in a year or so. It's not just a minor change in thinking. And how do you counteract things like this? Speculation activities don't cause the fault, and if there's some dirty bits it's basically the same thing. If there is a countermeasure that can change things in just one year please go ahead and suggest it.
The PC I've been using for 6 consecutive years broke last year, The number of shipments at  last is at the level of 10 years ago, you do not have to do anything with your source as well there being sophistication and intuition.

Bitcoin has surpassed $9,500, and I have also started to weaken.
Bitcoin.com's chief technology officer: "I sold my Bitcoins and I switched to Bitcoin Cash."
If the bitcoin is issued to the upper limit, what happens to the mining money?
Bitcoin and almost all forms of virtual currency are losing value fast. There was also a short time when all transactions were suspended. The value is unstable so it is hard to use it in transactions. Even if you do use it, it would only be for black market transactions. You need a vast amount of electricity to shovel something up. There is no value in using it and the tax cost is enormous. Therefore, it is hard to use it on transactions and can only become an object of investment. I only have one word to say to someone that spent a lot of money on virtual currency. Welcome to the hell of selling sold items.

Japanese subtitles added to "Firewatch" on Steam / GOG via free update. First person adventure that paints a delicate picture of human relations over a transceiver.

Hugtto! PreCure is amazing. I don't know much about other Toei works, but in the case of PreCure, it feels like depending on the year and the episode things are scattered. From the start with season 1 through season 3 or 4 things would come to a close at the end of a season with 12 or 24 episodes in pretty standard fashion. But with each passing year the overall quality improves, and recently even aside from those wrapups the image quality is good and they are well produced, and as far as years go there are some years where they keep the quality high without missing a beat. I am filled with expectation hoping that this is one of those years.

I wonder if LLL can be more lively. It seems like people with those types of ears are like that. With Niowan (deodorizing toilet paper), when I touch my armpit and smell it it smells like body odor. But, to change the subject, don't a surprisingly large number of cute girls have armpit body odor? If there were a service where that type of girl wore office clothes and worked really hard and got worn out and had that working woman feeling then it'd really get me hard.
We've got to get people more active in r/lowlevelaware... That's what they say about people with hearing like that. I can't smell it, but if I touch my armpits and then sniff them, they smell like body odor. To change topic, have you noticed that cute girls often have smelly armpits? There are some shops where, as a bonus, the girls wear office outfits. That look like they've been working hard and gotten tired is so sexy, I get a boner instantly.

EA is always throwing gasoline on the fire, and they are bringing themselves down, and at the same pace as usual sales will continue and things will end with reviews of a mediocre game.

THQ Nordic announce the purchase of Koch Media.  Deep Silver, known for the 'Saint's Row' and 'Metro' series now comes under their umbrella. The Metro series hopes to establish a Japanese language supplementary product.  THQ is the Nordic, which is the Titan new DLC etc.  It is hoped there will be a Japanese language supplementary version of de Blob 2, which has not been on sale in Japan.  It would be great to have everything under the high status Metro brand.  There are a great number of actual games, which are complex, so I'm happy to see these improved.  Truly, the Home Flow 2 DLC gains a pass mark from me. NB: The bar is not set very high.

Today I learned. Japan's birthrate is too low, in the past six years adult diaper sales have passed those for baby diapers. r/todayilearned You are an idiot. No matter how hard many men work they can't even get their hands on sex robots, nobody would work hard in a hell like that. About 80% of the reason men work hard is to get sex, so there's no way that taking that away is a change for the better. Growth in the West is built on immigration and the exploitation of Asia, but those are almost at their limit. With Asian independence and a lack of sex being supplied to the losing males in the West, it will all end for real. The value of women will crash and women will work to support some men, but there's no way that can last so in the end it will mean ruin.

Politeness isn't just about the strength and wording of the answer. It's the basic belief that flows from the remark and the determination. So if a trusted subordinate makes a mistake, even if the Prime Minister, as the person in charge, says "I did not say that", because of his resolve and position, isn't it that he should take responsibility?  You have to realize that you can't defy the budget committee. A position and resolve to "take responsibility"  Preaching to monkeys, praying to raccoon dogs

Lully Miura: "To be honest, if we can't even make comments like this, then Japan is going to find it impossible to really debate national security. I myself am privy to workshops with politicians and bureaucrats, as well as from meetings with experts who asked to remain nameless; while I cannot disclose all of my sources, this case is considered common knowledge among experts, nor is it the first time it is discussed in the media.
Miura Lully "Honestly, if this level of comment is difficult, then having a proper discussion on safety in this country is not possible. I myself have information I've gained from symposiums with politicians and bureaucrats as well as from experts speaking on condition of anonymity, so I am unable to disclose all of my sources, but for this matter among experts there is a common understanding, and this isn't the first time it's been reported by the media." This was my first time reading a long piece from Lully. Taking results from America and international politics, and having a free discussion to try to confirm threats like North Korea and China... I guess that's the style she's using. It's just like how when a crackpot researcher explains aliens or UFOs they always bring up "NASA did..."

Games are not just for high level people. As always Ark uses last generation matchmaking and isn't being improved. Tekken hasn't been improved since the 7th generation arcade machine, and there's also that thing with character selection. Since 3 the household version has been continually getting worse. There are still rumors that the developers and top players are in collusion. Capcom does have the most stable matchmaking, but they are trying to reproduce the arcade timed releases for household use, and while I personally do think it's interesting and tried it, other than that it's been neglected and left to die. In the end they just keep referencing back to EVO, and it feels like no matter how you choose there aren't any developers doing a great job. ~~ SEGA? Tecmo? SNK? Who knows ~~

US army responsible for frequent accidents. Marine Corps says 37% of helicopters are ready for flight. No, the response was that of the weapons installed, it's standard for only 30% to be active.

According to the original article, a liutenant general with the Marine Corps reported that the rate of online helicopters for the Marines is not more than 37%. So if you look at that reference, even though it's unclear to what extent that has decreased, you can clearly tell that for the Marines, it's now at a level too low to ignore. Simply put, it may be nothing more than a plea for an expanded budget.

This is the dream that I had. I bought tigers to eat for about a week. Even though I say tiger, they were more like tiger cubs. They arrived alive and I needed to kill them first. I followed the instructions of the manual and wrapped a towel around their head. I then hit them against the wall several times killing them. They were very ferocious even though they were cubs. After I hit them against the wall rather aggressively, I ate them. They tasted like chicken and had a rather unique crispy taste. It was delicious. My heart vibrates when reading Yuu‚Äôs paragraph.
I had a dream today: I bought an tiger for eating at an internet site, for about a week.  Although it was described as a tiger, it was just a baby, about the size of a kitten. The tiger was delivered alive, so I thought I had better slaughter it.  I looked at the manual and it told me to wrap the tiger's head in a towel and bash it against a wall several times to kill it. It was fierce for a baby.  I desperately kept bashing it against the wall.  When I had killed it, I ate it just as it was.  It was delicious; tender and crunchy, like chicken flesh.  Surplus energy.
Today's ramen was a good deal.

If you have any mercy, reject me by my application. I took a day out of my busy work schedule just to go to this interview. Or should I say, it's the desperation of someone like me who left school, and only has work experience as a programmer, and such. Is it that they have a norm of interviewing a certain number of people every day?

Old ladies just need to become stronger. But if old ladies become strong we're going to get beaten to death. Super strong cyborg grandmas are going to go around killing everyone. How scary.
If you are going to be a caregiver then I recommend you get your RN license.
The bad environment around nursing care... 24 hour 365 day individual care for a monthly income of 200,000 yen, sexual harassment an everyday occurrence.
The dark environment of caregiving... Providing individual attention 24 hours a day 365 days a year for 200,000 yen per month, sexual harassment is a daily occurrence. This is tough... I wish they would make some welfare system changes addressing the number of people in charge, the care, the paid time off, etc. But as for the wages the base level is about the same in the US. Also, I think it'd be good to do one bath per week. It is too much of a burden on the caregivers, and for elderly people there is no real need for them to bathe all that often.
French Actress Deneuve Criticizes Excessive Sexual Harassment Accusations: 'It's a Witch Hunt', 'We Must Recognize the Freedom to Seduce'.
French actress Deneuve is criticizing excessive sexual harassment indictments. She commented, ‚Äúit is a witch hunt,‚Äù ‚Äúfreedom of speech should be recognized,‚Äù ‚Äúpeople are being instantly punished and losing their jobs for touching someone‚Äôs lap and trying to kiss him/her.‚Äù She defended men by saying they are losing their honor unfairly. However, those kind of men are a problem.
French actress Ms. Deneuve denounces excessive sexual harassment allegations, declaring it a "witch hunt" and that "men should be free to hit on women." She pointed out that "men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss," and for this, men's reputations have been unfairly damaged. You can't tell if a stomach is hard or soft until you touch it (pets).

The patent numbers that Nintendo is suing Colopl over for patient infringement has come to light. I'll explain them the best I can. Also, they have a thing that is like Konami's wall camera and moreover, Nintendo's legal department is the strongest. I think all of these are extremely important patents. I think it would be strange if anyone other than Nintendo used them and sued. It's only a matter of course to let them use it without suing.

Leave it up to the wind. Leave it up to the ball. Will golf become a "sport that you enjoy by watching"?: Nihon Keizai Shinbun. Due to advancements in equipment and training, even if professional records skyrocket, there is no reason for the number of players competing in the Suso competition to decline. The better you are, it's only because of competing that you can know your actual level. But golf courses are planned by taking into account driving distances of professionals so for normal players they become "courses you can't get a good score on", and while that is a negative, at any rate there are handicaps so it doesn't really make a difference. But handicaps are an odd convention, aren't they?

Coping with a shortage of butter: plan to import 13,000 tons next fiscal year. Have the tigers run until they turn into butter (how cruel)
Avoiding a butter shortage. Import ceiling of 13,000 tons for the new year. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issues subsidies for protection of dairy farmers, with production being restricted to selected entities to keep the price of milk steady. Doing this nothing will change. Every year the amount of milk produced is set to keep the price of milk just as it is, so if there is an unexpected rise in demand or fall in supply there is no way to make preparations. A season for making preparations is essential and it can only be during winter, so if there isn't enough it can't be produced without being imported. If there's extra then the price of milk will drop so dairy farmers won't make a profit. But the price of milk is kept steady, so the income for dairy farmers is being maxed out, and in the end they'll have no choice but to give up the profession. At any rate, even if butter is imported there are quality protections, so it seems like one thought is maybe it's fine if it isn't produced in Japan.
This year we wont have and eel shortage go forward agriculture!

800,000 yen in social game charges for game addict... the grief of a man who cannot stop playing even in a divorce crisis. Now in the School Face event there is a computer bug that gives high scores and makes large obsolete charges while laughing and making a bright red face. The bound situation is that * Bug is used ‚Üí if BAN is received it is common for an account that has spent hundreds of thousands of yen  * Bug is not used ‚Üí BAN and things like minor charges will be pulled out by the score ranking. Management has released an update fixing the bug but updating is optional
Bills reach 800,000 yen due to addiction to social games... Lamentation of man in his 40s who is unable to quit despite possibility of divorce. Right now with the School Festival event there is a bug with the high scores, but getting red in the face while wasting so much money on the game is laughable. * Use the bug ‚Üí If you receive a ban the account you've put over a million yen into is gone. * Don't use the bug ‚Üí People who don't mind using the bug will get a higher score than you despite spending hardly any money. That's the tough situation. They released a new version that fixed the bug, but they said that the update is not compulsory

Among all 28 nations, Japanese men spend the least time on household chores at an average of 14 minutes. No matter what country's point of view you look at it from, Japan is discriminatory toward women and has abnormal views on time for household chores, with women still tending to spend way longer. The level of household burden for males in Japan is at the minimum level. It's because in Japan it's the housewives who hold the money... Compared to other countries, if you don't compare that as well then the comparison has no meaning.

Twitter deems cover of "light novel" illustrated fiction bok for all ages as pornography, shuts down ads for it.
The cover of a light novel intended for all ages is treated as porn on Twitter, advertisement ceases. As expected, chibukuro (breasts) give too much of a stimulus to the average person. "Chibukuro" is a classical expression... In the past Tezuka Osamu, Nagai Go, and Topminaga Ichiro all drew them.
The acknowledgement on Twitter that the cover for an illustrated fiction novel intended for all ages was an advertisement for a porno was denied. I guess that the average person's urge to fondle breasts is too strong. Of course, nipples are no excuse. Besides, this will just fade into obscurity as another idiotic, patriotic porno.
The advertisement of the cover of the light novel geared toward all ages was rejected on Twitter because it was recognized as porn. Is it because seeing breasts for ordinary people are too stimulating or is it because the United States' "all ages" is stricter and more fine than Japan's (surely Pokemon and Cardcapor Sakura were caught).

If you think about it calmly, if you have your girlfriend at work, then there is a risk that things would be awkward if you split up or have an argument.
If you think about it rationally, even if you find a girlfriend at work, if you break up or get dumped it will be uncomfortable, and there are various risks, right? I've never used it so I don't know, but I know an example of meeting via SNS. There are cases where things come together with somebody who Tweets like they are around the same age (Misty from Pokemon was my first crush, I watched Battle Athletes, etc.). So being of similar age you start to talk and get closer, and through popular things like Hatsune Miku or Vocaloid you get even closer, then while kidding around with online sex (like saying, "Let's ***." Wait, it's coming from them so it's not sexual harassment) it becomes earnest online sex, and you both start talking about meeting up, so you settle on a place to meet through direct messaging, then you start dating. Well, for my younger brother, by the way, he thought they were the same age but she was actually four years younger, so when they met he was a freshman at college and she was a 9th grader, kind of like that. She seemed to be into things that you'd expect of somebody the same age, so until they actually met he thought they were the same age. When she opened up it turned out she was a 9th grader, a cute, good girl. She did chores at home, and maybe the little sister was jealous or unable to stomach things, so she ended up making a mess of things and breaking them up.

In a survey employing plagiarism checking software, it has come to light that over 20 of Shakespeare's works use lines and phrases copied from other work. The phrases originate from a 1576 unpublished manuscript by George North. The title is somewhat misleading, as the main thrust of the article could be read to imply that the software could be used to find potential sources for use when plagiarizing. That being said, I do think it is true that there has traditionally been, in literature, the works of Shakespeare included, a strong interest in published works (and less interest in unpublished works or manuscripts).

\\nI went to an English language study group and couldn't understand a thing.
When I went to my partner's study group, there was an English session and honestly I had no idea what they were talking about.  The word English(eigo) is a language that people in [Ëã±ÂõΩ] speak, therefore it is called English.  Ëã±ÂõΩ refers to England (England).  If we prompt the question as to why England came to be called Ëã±ÂõΩ, it goes back to the Dutch language.  They called England „ÄåIngle„Äçin Dutch, and Japanese people heard "Egeresu".  They matched that "E" sound with the Kanji character „ÄåËã±ÔºàeiÔºâ„Äç.  This is why English came to be called „ÄåËã±Ë™û„Äç.
I went to an I.T. study group and there was an English session, and frankly I didn't understand anything. Midway, the presenter (while gesturing): "Should I speak slowly?"  Me: "(Doing the same gestures towards him)" ‚Üí I got the present to understand and he said, "OK, I'll speak a little slower!" but after 5 minutes he was back to the same speed.

The government is considering giving grants to Nago City with the aim of promoting local understanding.  There are some people who want to work in Henoko, who maybe would not be able to resist this carrot dangled in front of them.
Why the citizens of Nago chose Mr. Taketoyo who approves of relocation ‚Üí Because the mood spread due to a strong push from the Abe administration. The local people's income doesn't amount to much, and of course when money is dangled in front of their eyes... To have to choke out your true feelings must be spicy.
Nago mayoral election, fair ballot development is the key  Asahi Shimbun exit poll  I wonder if they're improving fairness with a low voter turnout?
In the Nago City election, was it actually the "for the base" group rather than the "against the base" group that held the popular support?
Taketoyo Toguchi, elected mayor of Nago, ignored inconvenient questions from reporters, declared acceptance of the Henoko base, and also abolished regularly press conferences. The citizens of Nago prioritized economic sophistry over the issue at hand by electing a Liberal Democrat.

Rumor: Microsoft is looking into acquire EA and Valve, as well as PUBG Corp, and although it looks like the PUBG acquisition will go ahead, MS shareholders are highly unlikely to approve the purchase of EA and Valve. I guess the rumor that they have completed the collection of money used in the MOJANG acquisition is right.
Rumor: Microsoft considers purchasing EA, Valve, or PUBG Corp. At Valve, starting with the founder, there are numerous former Microsoft employees, so it fits well. But please don't go for a game graveyard company like EA.
Rumor: Microsoft is considering acquiring companies like EA, Valve, and PUBG Corp  300,000 primary school students gathered up and laughed

Slurring and pronunciation is unclear Shinzo Abe's anxiety in the ordinary session of the Diet The cause of his resignation of the first regime was because of "incurable illness of intestine," but after all, when seeing him eat bbq meat with the attitude of the wind blows where it wants to, it looks like it's just a "sickness" to runaway using feigned illness

Government provides more than 90% of the investment for Japan Display. Financial records for 9 months yield 100.6 billion yen deficit.

Maybe they can cry and throw themselves on the mercy of Hon Hai Precision? (Provocation)

I want to hope lol
People close to him are treated very importantly.
If all of the answers in the Diet so far were lies, then the tens of billions of yen used in the Diet was completely wasted.
Mr. Aoyama, who has been sneakily trying to hide Kagoike from the National Diet, makes an excellent accessory.
In the end, young people asking questions wasn't what was turning the National Diet into a side show of time killing; it was the political opposition stealing too much time that was set aside for questions. Ichita: "Can I get you to say 'I'm supportive'?" Abe: "I'm supportive!!!" Ichita: "Hiroshige Sek≈ç, please say "It's fine, isn't it!" Sek≈ç: "It's fine, isn't it!" The whole world can see through this horrible acting.
Diet. In the end, the younger ones can't ask questions. Too much question time stolen from opposing party, Ichita makes a show of wasting time "Would you say that you are rooting for it?" Abe "I am!" Ichita "Minister Sekou, please say, 'That's enough!'" Sekou "That's enough!" "Would you say you love me?" "I love you!" "Please say, 'Ore TUEEE!'" (I'm overwhelmed) "Ore TUEEE!" Is there an echo in here?
The Diet session ended before the young people could ask questions because of the opposite party taking too much time with questions. Trying to put on a time killing side show. Ichita: "Can I have you say you're supporting us?" Abe: "I'm supporting you!" Ichita: "Minister Seko, please say 'That's good!'" Seko: "That's good!" You're stealing too much tax dollars.

[Poverty in this country is absolutely your fault] \\nRakugo comedians show off their deadly wit in internet flames.  Sankei has written that the conservative opinion leaders are  increasing in their numbers.  Conservative (large C) is not conservative.  A conservative is different from groups who want extreme changes to our society.  The Conservatives supported by Sankei are reformist groups.  What these groups are saying is 'Things are getting bad, but its not society's fault, its yours'. These Conservatives want things to remain the same to escape reality, which is different from being truly conservative. \\n

The end of a National Crisis breakthrough. If I'm not mistaken, the prime minister said that and was elected. However, seeing now that the director of the National Tax Agency is covering for the Prime Minister's wife abusing her political authority, and the reality that he's now running around like a fugitive criminal, and seeing the average citizen loosing their faith in the tax administration, more than breaking through the national crisis, its more like it's expanding. Now I'm certain. The prime minister himself is the national crisis. Like a child in a man's body, thy name is the Prime Minister of National Crisis!
The national crisis is what the prime minister is doing, so it's a lost cause.
It's a good piece of land, so please proceed.

The important thing is that the the alignment between the philosophy of the current administration and the views of the popular comedians of the day is not always pandering or aligning to the establishment view, but is what they really think, and the mainstream view among we modern Japanese people. It feels like, well, 'if I, who is currently successful, doesn't have the same views as the current 'winners' within society, who does?'. People who pretend they have the winners' views despite actually being weak often become actual winners, or at least think they have, don't they? Even if it's just ostentation, they can use a winning mindset to get women even if they're horrible, and if you actually tell women you're weak you won't be popular with them.

Of course if you do sports or move around they'll dig in. That's to be expected, but underwear with a smaller area digs in more easily Larger underwear doesn't dig in as much. And, since middle school girls have increasingly large butts, relatively speaking the underwear is getting smaller, so it digs in more? By the way I take care of panpoji?

I was in a bad mood because that girl refused my invitation to eat together, so I went to a sex service place at the end of the year. Then today I broke out in eczema(?) from my shoulder down to my hand. If it's a sexually transmitted disease try a urologist. If you go to a urology clinic you should be able to find out whether it's a sexually transmitted disease. If you get an examination at a private one, the results should take about a week, but if it's something major they should tell you within a day.
Reeling from being rejected to dinner by that girl, I went to get myself some sexual services, only to wake up with a rash from my shoulder all the way to the back of my hand?  Venereologist or urologist  There should be a venereologist in the urologist's office   At the small clinics the tests will take about a week, but if you go to the larger clinics I heard you'll get your results in one day
As I got miserable because that girl refused my invite to go out for dinner, at the end of the year I went to a brothel, but today I noticed a red eczema from my shoulder to the back of my hand? Should I wait and see or go to the hospital should it be a dermatologist

More animations now seem to feature 'women with sour expressions wanting to flash their knickers.'
So "I want her to show me her underwear with a disgusted face" will be animated.
I want you to show me your underwear while making a displeased expression to be made into an anime, starring Ishigami Shizuka and others.
'Show me your knickers with a sour face'\\nAn animation starring Shizuka Ishigami and others.  Does this appeal to the M, or the S customer base?  For those in the SM club, delighting in the perverse pleasure of being abused and put down by the queen would be easy to understand.  This is somewhat S in approach, so it is hard to understand how this perversion can be offset. \\nIf it is neutral, then the unpleasant face would not really be funny, it would be an apology with a droopy willy, which is not the same as being balanced. It is further complicated by not being anchored to the SM axis. Addendum: Is this for perverts? Its easy to see how it appeals to this kind of customer.

Public recognition for giving birth to four children. Ogi Mama's "comment making a fool of women" to Liberal Democtratic Party member Santo. No, isn't it saying that Mr. and Mrs. Abe who haven't had even one kid should be punished? That, that's what I'm trying to say.

It will probably traumatize kids.
The author of the book 'Children's rights and United Nations Conventions in the UK' seems to have been caught out by the issue of child rape.  If it was judged from the point of view of middle aged women, it would be irrelevant.  United Nations representative also criticised the sexualisation in Japanese comics as part of its mandate for protecting the rights of children.  I think it was a mistake from a tweeter on twitter.

Gudako and her husband are always acting homosexual.
It goes up to her uterus so I can't move around.
The true feelings of childless women that they don't want to reveal. Japan's labor environment being poor is also an issue, but I wonder if it's more that the women aren't prepared to raise children. I was raised in Japan after it became poor, but the young newlyweds that I know aren't like that. You shouldn't act like the old women in their 40s and 50s who were raised back when Japan was flourishing who search for a rich husband. There are some "3K" (good academic background, high income, tall) bachelors out there, but there aren't many of them (the 3K bachelors actually out there either have bad personalities or are ugly). I think soon it will be commonplace for both husbands and wives to do both work and household chores and raising kids. If the situation regarding Japanese business isn't considered, the declining birth rate won't go away.

Judging this has messing around would be improper.
Well, not everything can be learned at school.
Even though it is becoming an "Endangered species" at the current school, even if you remember that there was a teacher who used classes with OHP, do not you remember who it was?
Now at schools they have become "endangered species". No way! When I was in elementary school there wasn't even an Inkjet printer?! I thought that was the case and looked it up, but there was an Inkjet printer ‚àë(¬∞‚ñ°¬∞) . I see. The one used by OHP was an Inkjet... My older brother would call the Inkjet a laser printer, so I thought, "You dang youngster!", but was it not younger than me? Ugh.

I'll tell you how to eliminate an academic inferiority complex. For the Hokuriku region, then Kanazawa University is okay. For Kyushu maybe it's Kyushu University. Hokkaido and Tokyo are a no go. As for Nagoya University, I don't like Nagoya so there's no way.
I will tell you a method to get rid of academic history complexes. This was my complete test results. I am not at an age to get a complex but I had one. I didn‚Äôt take the test with a B grade without being able to get an A. I regretted more not taking the test than theorizing if I had passed.

Democratic Party in trouble with "Abe Strong", so are the ideas of "dissolving the party" or "renaming the party" still alive? That kind of seems like a dirty trick.
Abe is the main culprit, but its incidence is expanding.
Abe, a murderer?
Abe and his party have in some way been successful in putting on a 'new strength' political circus show.
Prime Minister Abe's former security and current assemblyman of the Yamaguchi prefecture apologizes for breaking the bones of an old man on the city council.
Is this backed by Yagi Hidetsugu, the brain of Abe?
This is, after all, Abe‚Äôs mass media.
Abe Cabinet, craziness of 60% members come from the politician family... 14% decrease of the national income in the past 15 years, twice more for the household with zero asset There is no meaning sinceTokyo university is basicary inherited system
46% of people "support" the Abe cabinet while 37% do not.| NHK  News This will make Japan a happy country of science...
Approval rating for Abe cabinet is 55%. Increased by 5 points from the previous survey. Disapproval rating is 37% as per Nikkei public opinion poll ..to put in other way, it is said that it is extremely frail scandal . ~ ~ honor ~ ~ do it for dishonor recover
The Abe cabinet support rate has plummeted to 48%...Yomiuri public opinion poll.
The approval rating for Abe's cabinet has fallen 48% according to Yomiuri News paper public opinion poll. Isn't it missing a period? shouldn't it be 4.8?
Prime Minister Abe "It is pathetic, morning sort of miserable excuse, it was as expected".
Prime Minister Abe "It is pathetic, a sort of miserable excuse likely as Asashi, it was as expected." Anti Abe is still shadow boxing with an invisible enemy. What bloody secretary consigns to a contractor, he does not have time for these opponents
Prime minister of the Abe Cabinet "How pathetic. A miserable excuse that's just like Asahi. Just as expected." Who cares, but for about two years Kayama Rika has been going to a gym for Krav Maga and self defense. When attacking Abe even in a physical contest, you can't win intellectually haha.

This cliche is tedious and overused.

Abe supporters are spreading the vicious discriminatory rumor that "'The distictiveness of this matter' of the Moritomo papers are the same as the treatment of the untouchables"!
Abe cheerleaders are spreading false rumors that "The 'special characteristics' of the Moritomo documents are about social integration"  Is the source Takaya Imai, secretary to the prime minister?  Akheed and Nippon Kaigi were about social integration.
The Abe supporters are spreading the divisive false rumor that "The Moritomo document's 'specific topic' is unified peace"! Could the source be Secretary to the Prime Minister, Takaya Imai? Completely forgetting about the "music university bid" has become a template for the Internet right.

Although two years have passed since he quit the representative of Ishinha, I understand why Abe like toru so much

Abe's "reality" lies only in restaurants in Akasaka and his own mother's homemade cooking.
Abe was a head legislator if I remember.
Little Abe, you don't really need to attend the Pyongchan Olympics.  If I were you I would not even have wanted to attend the National Assembly, with it being so hot for you.  With such a short attendance schedule I would not have been able to use this excuse, so would have to use some sort of political posturing as an excuse.  Is that the reason for avoiding it? There's a rumour on the 2nd floor that improvement in relations with China and Korea was part of a deal made with cabinet.  The number one must be the US.
Abe says he will eventually attend the Pyongchan Olympics, because the 6 country summit will be held at Pyongchan.  It was only Japan who left the negotiating table.  We were forced into getting the Prime Minister to attend as the only way to restore the damage.  Originally it would have been the Foreign Minister, but the present one, Ota, seems like an inferior copy of Abe.  He was refused on the 2nd floor of Okata Aso.
Prime Minister Abe, as you were saying before this is... ah, I'm sorry!

Prime Minister Abe to criticize Asahi again = Liberal Democratic Party member posts on Facebook that's right, such an overwhelming feeling of being a nobody, can't even compare to Ichita.

What did the media in Estonia say about the arrival of Prime Minister Abe? ‚Üí As for the "pressure on North Korea for cooperation" that the Japanese side had been touting, Estonia didn't really focus on that in broadcasts.

Bad, Abe, bad.  The Prime Minister will skip a passage in his speech relating to free high school education. The ruling parties are, like, 'Oh so sorry, we'll add it to the minutes even if he doesn't read it out.'  That may be sufficient, but it all seems rather petty.
Silly Abe, while giving a speech as the prime minister he skips right over the part about making high school education free. Ruling party "Whoops haha sorry haha, we didn't read it, but we'll just add it to the records haha." The records are being "dealt with" by the self proclaimed parliamentary democratic nation. Go and look up in a dictionary what "records" actually means ‚Üí The dictionary has been falsified... This might be the future we have in store. War becomes peace (earnestly pushing forward). Freedom becomes slavery (achieved). Ignorance becomes power (achieved).

As expected it's essentially slavery, about 90% of businesses that bring in foreigners as technical trainees operate illegally. (I feel like I wrote something like this before, but) no matter how you slice it 90% is not the same as 100%. And with such an unusual rate the country really can't control things at all, rather it's that the country "is doing it knowingly". Things have already collapsed, but rather than doing anything fundamental they just employ stopgap measures and gloss over things. At this rate it won't be long before things are truly over.
\\nAs expected, it's complete slavery  Approximately 90% of foreigners receiving technical training are operating illegally  Western interns in Japan are illegal immigrants  This is a horrible thing

Elementary school rape is a crime.
The lewd former lecturer said to 12 children at the primary school, 'I want awareness of sexual fetishes'. Those kinds just can't get it up.
An elementary school teacher said to a class of 4th graders, "Do you all know about sexual intercourse?" She then continued to talk about her own experiences and said things like "Your teacher does it too". If the teacher were in her 40s or 50s then I can picture a comic with a virgin repeatedly saying it's gross. To respond to it seriously, the number of parents/guardians is double the number of students, and if even one of them is a landmine then this will become a problem. School teaching has become something like a sport of avoiding landmines, so a teacher who talks about her own sexual experiences should be criticized. (She might be a good teacher, but if even a single parent sees that as a problem then it's no good.)
A primary school teacher asked her 4th years students whether they knew about the sex act.  The responses reflected the children's experience.  "Teacher, you are doing it too" etc. The teacher's home page shows too much overtime, and it is always zero.... When I was a student I always thought Saturday classes were a bother,  but from an assistant teacher's point of view, it is extra work with only 1000 yen for lunch money as compensation. To all the teachers who taught me well;  I'm really sorry.
A primary school teacher asked her 4th year class 'do you know about the sex act'?  The children spoke from their own experiences 'Teacher, you are doing it' etc.  How quickly things turn to shit.

Are convenience store onigiri getting smaller? Rice prices are soaring to stop depletion. If you think about it with common sense, stopping depletion‚Üíincreases supply‚Üíprice is reduced. I've heard that everyone wants to make branded rice, but the rice business is a field that seems to have a future, and I have a feeling that it might become polarized. It's strange that it's so extreme, but maybe it's specialization. It is said that there is a type of rice that's suited for beef bowls to be used in beef bowls, one that's suited for curry in curry, one suited for onigiri in onigiri, and it is said that there is a movement for rice production in cooperation with the restaurant industry. To simply say rice business=cheap rice is not the case, and I wonder if it will become more specialized by its usage. Well, the restaurant industry tends to buy up the rice but the amount ordered is stable so there may be an advantage in joining hands. In this aspect the situation is pretty different from milk, which has varied pricing. In the medium to long term the trend of reduction in household rice consumption must be tough. Don't forget about rice sable cookies!

Enon Kawatani: "What would be weird is a world without tabloids." Of course the don't realize it's being protected by One Power. ROCKIN' ON JAPAN is misunderstood, what they said wasn't that. Nagabuchi is starting to appear on TV recently, but if he gets famous for Sakurai not being there, no matter how bad his quality gets, even if he stops writing music, the price of fame will be funneled through choice words of excuse. Since the majority of countries that breed people with traits like that overcome adversity, even if they don't make a company, they will easily crush us. It's fine, we're fine.
Enon Kawatani: "Society is the one that's diseased, not the tabloids." Hmm, does he mean that the tabloids aren't in the wrong because they're just putting out what sells, and society is the one that's actually morbid? I think a public institution should be more aware that it's a public institution. It's not just reflecting society, it also has a role in swaying society.

Three women attempt to smuggle gold in the shape of a pad concealed in a bra, the hardness of their breasts was noticed by an employee and they were arrested. If they'd gone with a gold amalgam then I think it would have been soft, but there are probably other methods, and while I wouldn't think of stooping to this level, it seems like the smuggling was because of Japanese consumption tax. There aren't that many countries where that kind of tax exists. If they sold it in Japan they'd be making extra money for the consumption tax portion, and by using that money for further exports they'd have no lack of future funds to use.

Common people shall have their face branded. Those who requested the false document(s) shall also be branded." Let's banish Abe to Iwo Jima. Since Akie Abe is a private individual, let's brand her face.
Feudal justice system\\n\\nAnyone forging a document shall have their land confiscated.  Landless people shall be banished. For common people, their face shall be branded.

Something you want to say to someone who has been dumped, well. But if you suppose that I have the right to chose, then in terms of a contest of attractiveness I don't want to chose anybody else. If that feeling alone is strong, then the person who chose that person is a god.

Dinosaurs died out because flowers bloomed  It seems to be in fukase's lyrics
The dinosaur destroyed it because a flower bloomed there.
The dinosaurs went extinct after flowers bloomed. It seems possible that large dinosaurs who could only eat gymnospermous plants went into decline. I wonder if the taste was different? Or maybe angiosperm plants were poisonous to dinosaurs? (After all there are a decent number of food which are fine for humans but which dogs and cats can't eat.)

Netizens point out that Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra's new album cover resembles the style of Fujiko F. Fujio.
Kasupara, was this pointed out online?  Replacing the jacket.  A 'Fujiko F' type design...  The primary school administration declined to comment. The illustrator who drew it said it is a copy.  Its more like eating with** TrePak** in typical Sano style. In common with the Sano style it has poor artistic merit.  Along with this poor artistry is a disproportionately warped sense of self worth. The person calls himself an art copier, but that is too complimentary.  The line is non existent and there is no love or feeling for the form of the original.  Generally the art copier is a genuine artist who has actually studied techniques in copying and become an expert.  That's not the case with someone like Itako.  And speaking of Itako, there are those who have studied the drawings of master cartoonists like Keiichi Tanaka, have mastered them, **and put their own special stamp on them**.  These artists create parodies that the Itako types don't understand, so that the world can laugh and cry at their creations.  They combine a love of the original with an unusual artistic sense to produce something new, ** reaching a stage where they no longer require Trepak to get them published.** So to summarise; they are not Sano types.
When I looked up Sky Palace online that jacket had been replaced with a Fujiko F style design‚Ä¶ Shogagukan refused to comment. The illustrator who drew it says that as opposed to copying the style, it's a **tracing scam** and it's a typical eating Sano Group‚Ä¶. Poor drawing skills are common in the Sano Group. As well as poor drawing skills, they have a totally biased, distorted, and bloated desire for recognition. It is also biased to call them a fraud. What is fake about something that has a dead line and whose original can‚Äôt event get any love? With fake artists, poor drawing skills is the first thing, then painting techniques are **studied and easily taken**. That makes me feel like saying you are like Itako people. Speaking of Itako, be like Tanaka Keiichi and study the style of a master cartoonist and get it yourself. There are definitely some people who are (**turning to your own shame**). Although the Itako cartoonist draws a nonsensical parody and publishes it to the world, making them laugh or frown, they are have the original paranoid love, mixed with abnormal drawing skills and good sense which holds it together (there's no longer a need to announce **arrival to a domain that does not need tracing scams**) so I that I can have a glance. They are not the Sano Group.

Do away with the phrase 'part time employment' is a red faced lie, and behind it lurks mechanisms for maintaining the current disparity.
Private person with official government recognition on the Moritomo scandal "I think I really want to know the truth"  On the contrary, Akie went and called for the summoning witness and said nothing to Tani who only visited Moritomo  If you testify that you didn't influence anything, the opposition party will have a fit  I want the summoning witness to leave quickly  Mrs. Abe is trying to extinguish the left, so it can't be helped  Please, summoning witness, leave for heaven's sake
the government promised Hitachi a loan guarantee using public public money for them to export Japanese nuclear power plant technology.
The government encourages work by revising the guidelines.
Of course I say that with contempt for the government.
The government and official residence don't look down on the "strangeness" of citizens  Prime Minister Abe's drill crushed 100 million slaves in a hole  This shitty feeling drill, it seems like my whole sphincter will also be torn!
Government plan: Asahi Shimbun Digital.
Government pushes for 3% wage increase, 70% of businesses reply that it is "not practical".
7 out of 10 companies answer that the 3% wage increase willed by the government is "not ideal"   Those light words are really floating    This is a stingy country

Teachers and students washed the toilet bowls with bare hands, and the minister drank water from the toilet ‚îÄ ‚îÄ. I want it to be a lie, but this is a solemn fact.

Thank you I'm on duty next week so I will not go rotten
Are Muslim targets increasing? Lesser extremists, Egyptian terrorists  More extreme people (conservative fundamentalist bigots from within that organization) will purge the more moderate members and desperately go out to commit outward aggression  In any era, no matter what organization, in reality convervative fundamentalists can't be dealt with, they will destroy the organization and spread harm to the outside world  Examples: Japan's Imperial forces, the North Korean Labor Party, IS, the Coalition Red Army, Feudal Monarchies, Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, etc.
The Pope said, "People who visit places of prostitution are bad, and prostitution is tantamount to torture of women" and even for a secular person it makes you want to die. When you think about it, there are plenty of middle school and high school girls who are just too happy to spread their legs for some spending money. The world isn't as glamorous as you'd like.
According to the text books, the Cabinet is the highest ruling authority in the country.

90% of educators have „ÄåCreative Problem solving skills„Äç.  Even understanding the importance of raising children, the lack of training and tools often becomes a burden.  This often happens.

Bungeishunju's "Hateful Commentator" brazenly moves into second place!
Bunshunho twitter gets slammed with negative comments... Flood of comments calling for a "stop in publishing" and more following suspicions of improper reporting with Komuro. But I still feel like that isn't enough of a reason for tons of people in the world to deny his character and make him a punching bag. Of course that also doesn't make it a reason for Komuro to be protected.
I guess this is some "meeting of cultural victims..."

This is called "context neglect quote."
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology announces plan for reform of high school curriculum. "Love for our country" included for first time. I though that what is important with history is to "use the events of the past to provide teaching that is relevant today", but it's somehow unpleasant, and there are things like culture and ideology, and looking down on arts colleges without even providing any money, saying they should love their country like this is a contradiction. Teaching so that people love, isn't that called brainwashing?

A newlywed girl was captured, spitting out blood, and suffering leg injuries. She was threatened to keep her mouth shut. Tokyo‚Äôs immigration authorities have a horrible refugee policy. Every time I look at this approach, I wonder if it would be ok for the United Nations to look at Japan as an enemy nation. This method of doing things is not good no matter how you look at it.

‚ÄùNewspaper Crisis" accelerated in a year. In the 20th century, I used to buy magazines like TECH Win and Jyaiaso to fulfill my desire. In fact, supplements in the disk were only means to get free software back then. It's a common sense today that anyone can open JPG, but looking back at the age when we couldn't open JPG without a supplemental dll file, I think that the time has changed amazingly.
News for newspapers: research reveals there is almost no value in the press releasing headshots of a victim. Worthwhile, or not? The netizens will surely decide.
Education for journalist would be no better "Need for newspaper companies and educational institutes to team up for training journalists"? After all newspapers are no longer newspapers, now they are oldspapers.

Pyon "Never being swayed by the tone of the current media, etc., with calm analytical skill and words that are easy to understand, Ms. Miura, who through criticism is still highly expected to be further active in the future as the first female winner as the aforementioned new style award" ahh... truly a Japanese person.
Pyon "without being swept away by the tone of existing media and with a cool, calming, easy to understand speech, Mr. Miura who has been through a lot of criticism says that we are looking forward to the further success of the first female winner of the new newspaper award" Ah... a person with damp earwax.
In Germany it is against the law to work in excess of 10 hours in one day. For a six month average one cannot exceed 8 hours per day. "Most workers use 100% of their 30 paid vacation days per year." "In one year 40% or approximately 150 days are not work days." "The German economy is excellent, and productivity per worker exceeds that of Japan by almost 50%." ??? "There is there! Here is here!"
Nippon TV, opinion poll finding that the Communist Party ranks 3rd in approval ratings hasn't come out  I thought a 34% response rate is suitably accurate lol, but looking at this kind of arbitrary concealment  After all, the opinion polls condicted by the Japanese media are based in various "conjectures (guilt)"
Japan TV.  According to opinion polls, the Communist Party is no. 3 in popularity.  There has been a revolution in the popularity ratings, eh! If the Communist Party is excluded, we can pick out just 5 parties from the beginning.  Its strange that nobody is concerned about that. Is it strange to allocate speaking to  political parties without supporting parties, according to a ratio. Other bureaus do this.
Nippon TV, opinion poll found that the Communist Party is ranked third in terms of support  Slowly but surely  Communist Party
Nippon Television, the result of polling opinion survey came out that the Communist Party's support rate was third place and treated it as it didn't happen With such things, people are going to call you guys "Farce reporters"

Why are older Japanese men the best at being isolated? I was thinking that if they're lonely they could join a religion, but Japan's no good at religious groups. Traditional religion is without the grace of God and greedy. New religions have fallen into organized systems without virtues.
Now that Japan completely got out performed by China, as a 26 year old I want to say that I agree with men like the 30 year old fujita youhei but for them to say that they would leave japan is an empty threat and does not look good.
Why were the Japanese PKOs killed in Cambodia? "The Truth of 23 Years" (Keigo Kaminari)   So his surname is written like that in Chinese characters.
Why does "the seriousness of falsification of official documents" not make any sense for Japanese people? This confusion that lurks in the "darkness" of this country is because in Japan, we have the ancient history and legends "the Kojiki and the Nihonshoki"....that's what I think
Articles in free newspaper for New York Japanese  The Sankei also has a free app.
Japanese customers don't return. "Wandering department store men." Isetan depression. No need to worry.

Abenomics, Abenomics, Abenomics.
The Germans invent it, the Americans commercialize it, the British invest in it, the French design it, the Italians publicize it, the Japanese downsize and improve its performance, the Chinese make pirated versions, and the Koreans claim to be the original inventors of it.

Why do Japanese people prefer a 35 year loan hell to living a loan free lifestyle.
Why do Japanese people choose the hell that is a 35 year loan over the freedom that comes with renting? Compared to the West the climate (humidity) is different, so I don't think they can be considered in the same way. Speaking of tough maintenance, even concrete falls apart with time. There are even numerous cases where it is cheaper to rebuild than it is to remodel. That's what the present situation is. People who buy houses and those who believe in building new ones are amazing. Taking a usable building and destroying it is truly wasteful (of course the word "wasteful" is mere lip service), and if our country becomes poor (foregone conclusion) then whether we like it or not they'll have to be reused.
Japanese people don't have the entrepreneurial spirit is an incorrect notion.| What is the real reason there are few startups? It is because it is much easier and safer to be an employee than to be an entrepreneur. I'm a son who's father was an entrepreneur, so you can believe me. Startups are easy paths for those with nothing to lose or who are already rich. There are turnarounds in life, but things do not turnaround with a single action. That is something worth remembering.
While Japan chose "north" as this year's Chinese character, New Zealand on the other hand chose "Please tell me that's not your penis" for quote of the year... Stop with the official verbal abuse
I thought that the ones used by Japanese might be lighters and smaller and might be better than the ones in America, but I wonder if that's the case...

Surprising response on Chinese internet to the question, "What is wrong with Japan?" I might have written this before, but despite being unable to accept others wanting them to know you and comfort you is something from the first stages of puberty. All of Japan acts like a middle schooler. I don't think that MacArthur's comment that "Japanese people are like 12 year old boys" was all that strange. Come to think of it, the way Nippon Kaigi thinks of neighboring countries without considering their viewpoints is basically the same as an emotional and narcissistic middle schooler.
'What is there about Japan that is really awful?'  Chinese netizens make some astonishing revelations about our dark side. The town councilor and deputy ministers'  apologies were mentioned.  These apologies still stand.

Japanese girls, 60% "in their next life want to be born as a foreigner" = Chinese media.
Well, why? 60% of Japanese girls "want to born in foreigners in the next life" = Chinese Media. To say the least, purgatory is from middle school to high school. Disppointing
Why? Chinese media reported that 60% of Japanese girls are saying, ‚ÄúI want to be born as a foreigner in my next life.‚Äù One would definitely be white if one was born in Japan as a foreigner.

You can easily get permanent residency if you have the skills that are fit for Japanese culture, such as in government, anime, or manga. It has to be assumed though, so I‚Äôll probably get deported even if I‚Äôm supposed to be Japanese.

Has English language education in Japanese improved?  There are too few ALTs (one or fewer per school). There is not enough time devoted to English classes, so they can't do anything serious.

Walking is considered aerobic exercise, and apparently you can lose weight if you continue with it. But in the end, you have to somewhat limit your diet too or else there aren't noticeable results.

Takasu Katsuya on winning at auction a transcript of a monologue by Emperor Showa, "National treasures must be reclaimed" given as reason. It seems like the contents could be falsified.
Takasu Katsuya wins monologue of Emperor Hirohito at auction, says the reason is that "national treasures must be recovered". The monologue is a memo from close associates (private friends) of Emperor Hirohito, it isn't something the Emperor wrote, and it isn't a nation treasure. The wife of the writer of the memo Terasaki Hidenari was American, and their daughter lives in America, so it was discovered in America. So basically it was something that was in America from the start and it isn't the case that it was "taken overseas". The monologue does have historical value, but the original memo itself isn't really all that valuable (that's why an individual was able to purchase it). The contents have already been published by Bunshu Bunko, and anybody in Japan can read them.

My standard of living is 'declining'.
There is less and less elbow room in livelihood: the answers from Bank of Japan's survey continue to grow. The ones that want to purport nuclear power as a national policy is the government and their offices. (Overall, over 70% of electric power is used for business (and about 30% is for homes, but that includes homes that are also businesses.)) You can't completely lower the probability of a nuclear accident to 0%. Sooner or later it's going to happen. As a counter measure against this, they are indirectly allowing the private electric companies and makers of heavy electrical equipment do it as a two shield strategy. (If this is the case, we won't be the ones to take the blame for an accident and and at the worst it will be omitted.) The reason I think this is if the power companies raise the electric fee for using the generators for whatever they are used for then they'll be fine and there is no reason to take on big risks.

In Japan's case, the reason they do things like setting up a US imperial style contribution system or have a community where the disadvantaged people help other disadvantaged people is because they're too fragile. Even if they distributed the earnings like the US imperialists do, it looks like the extremities would be forced to have a miserable life, more so than US imperialism.

Recently the DTB series hasn't rose.
Remarkable Recently, I haven't done it...
Recently, I had a hunch that my astigmatism has been getting worse, so I went to a glasses maker and had an eye test. I was told "You're astigmatism is going away." I've gone to glasses shops to try to get my astigmatism corrected as best as I can and after several years an ophthalmologist told me that I don't have astigmatism.
Recently I've finally gotten into Civilization V. I don't have much time so I can only play on my days off though.
Recently, it's hard to hear that it's not heresy that people are watching anime even though they are adults.
Recently the phrase "Even though you are an adult you watch anime" is not considered heretical and that's tough.
Recently heretical things like "I watch anime even though I'm an adult" aren't being said and it's difficult   Me "I look at 2chan"  friend "I also look at hamusoku"  I lost my friend
Lately there has been implied hatred of things Korean in serious Chikuma Gakugei Publishing books.
However, with his  recent flattery and the condition of the \\nnegotiations, I wonder how people can be deceived by him.

Let's talk about it!
Recently I am only throwing stuff away, so it should be fine.
Four characteristics of "Gorilla Girls" overflowing with tolerance  Because of that Morita Mariko's exposure has increased  It's the evolution of mankind!
The recent trend of "Not making fun of someone for being a virgin" is absolutely wrong.
Why haven't there been any threads lately? Huh? I'm gonna suck your dick.
I recently went to buy books with my salary.
Recently I've been buying tons of books with my earnings.

Ignoring a High Court decision.
Ignoring the Supreme Court ruling the Abe administration did not disclose the "Secret Bureaucracy Documents" Does the Commissioner of the Court not issue a statement? all you can do is laugh...

Monday is game day! Let's all chat together! 1) What should we chat about? Give your suggestions. I'm afraid after looking at the steam sales rankings. Ah, but I didn't look at the reviews. 2) Take a look, FPS gamers who influence solders are worse than performers with monkeys. 3) The provider can be changed.
Sunday is game day! Let's all chat together! 1, It was a good game before, but it ended up becoming greedy to it's core. The players have basically turned into animals.

Monday is game day! Everybody let's chat! I bought the old VITA for 20,000 a while ago, but the only vita game I've bought is Demon Gaze...... Even if I do play I'm satisfied with Arcade Archives and Free Play.
Monday is Game Day! Let's have a fun chat together. Idiot
Sunday is game day! Let's all chat together! On Darkest Dungeon I had a huge wipe with three characters dying and it killed my motivation, so I started playing the Zelda BotW DLC. The rehabilitation was going without a problem, and suddenly it was the part where you either die or kill in one hit and it was hilarious. I kind of headed in the direction of Mipha, and once again realized how truly amazing this game is. While moving north I kept thinking "Ah! I need to catch some armored carp!" Ah! I need to grab some fleet lotus seeds!" and getting strongly lured in, and I really felt like, "This is BotW." The Shield Breaker is really garbage and I won't use it again (warning).
Monday is game day! Everybody, let's chat! I listened to NieR's LP soundtrack. On a CD the sound is just "there", but on a record the music seems to be "alive". I like that pieces, such as Field of Resistance and Pascal's Village, that fit into NieR's coordinated scenes are included. Flipping it over is tedious, but there is definitely a worldview that can only be achieved through a record.

Monday is game day! Let's get the discussion going! I had been saving up since last week, so this morning I did ten in a row and got Black and Noir. The only one I need is green, so I should have the full set sometime this week. The union event is approaching as well, so the dock expansion is under review. I don't really care about how it looks, but is this going to get discarded? There's a limit to how much you can equip and reduce and it's getting scary how tight the inventory is.
Sunday is game day! Let's all chat together! I'd been saving them up since last week, so this morning I did 10 in a row and got noir and black. All I need now is green, so I should be able to complete them this week. The Union Event is also coming, so I'm considering expanding my dock. For outward appearance I personally don't care all that much, but can I just throw this away? There is only so much you can equip and decrease, and my inventory is so packed that it's scary.

Monday is Game Day! Let's have a fun chat. The Priest is apparently strong, so I thought they'd put that back in. I looked at the deck and it's too wild and overpowered. I lost my urge to play instantly.

Monday is games day!  Lets meet and mingle!  I have heard of a child who was taken out of school because he was so sick he was diagnosed with a mental illness. According to the doctor,  he had high intelligence, high achievement and understood moral complexities.   The doctor thought he should not have been born into a world where 'the only good people are those who die in battle'.
Monday is Game Day! Let's discuss with everyone!  I'm also worried the difference between the two, I'm still playing KanColle although it went off and died. But I don't have the passion for it like before. There aren't any new events or system innovations...\\nWell to begin with, I got the feeling that it's not a game for the smartphone or a smartphone compatible browser game lol
Sunday is game day!  Let's all chat!  There were too many potatoes so I was the one including opsops2 and turning on the scavenger and cooking a lot of them.  ops3 hasn't done enough to say too much.

Sunday is game day! Let's all chat together! Despite having the quiz fortune will it not be reused? In Taiyuan and Changchun until the event end, if there isn't one every day then try an extra 10 times. Donfan has a lot of skills that can be used to lead the Kantai, but there are probably battleships and aircraft carriers.
Monday is game night!  Let's all chat together!  I've been clearing Mario Odyssey little by little, and I'm finally on the last country.  At this point, the pros and cons have shown themselves and it makes me want to talk to others about it.  I think of things like, I would have shaved this portion off if the previous leader, Miyamoto was still in charge (Is the Odyssey ship even necessary?) or other things like, it's really something to marvel at this day and age that even though we can capture this many things, the controls aren't too shabby.  Just like Zelda: BotW, it's a game where you can just sense the change of staff when playing.
Monday is game day! Let's all chat together! Makai Wars and YuuKonamaiki are smartphone games that have become big names, and they're both fun.

Sudden death of Ariga Satsuki, 52 years old. At the forefront of the "boom in popularity of female announcers". Hid the fact she was fighting an illness. Oh man. RIP.
Ariga Satsuki, sudden death. The 52 year old started the "female announcer boom in popularity". Kept her illness hidden... One more famous person passes away... 52 is still so young... R.I.P.
Sudden death of Satsuki Ariga, 52. An instigator of the "women announcer boom", she hid her fight against illness... I was relatively surprised, but it looks like there had been whispers on entertainment websites that she had cancer, because of her massive weight loss and the fact that she was wearing wigs.

The person who criticized Asahi's name was actually changed, and that was actually also submitted by Kagoike's side.
Is the Asahi Shimbun group ready to take responsibility for their fabrication and omission of details?
Asahi Newspaper mistakenly uses the Twitter hashtag #Pyongyang Olympics instead of #Pyeongchang Olympics.
Report meeting held concerning the fake news on comfort women published by Asahi Shimbun. Mr. Kent Gilbert says "Asahi should conduct a verification based on the facts, and provide an explanation to the world", "There were comfort women", "This was huge fake news from Asahi", "The misinformation of Asahi and the reality of comfort women", "I'm saying Asahi published fake news"
Asahi Shimbun: 62 people living within and without Japan claimed being slandered due to incorrect facts being reported in this newspaper concerning comfort women, and they brought suit against us to print an apology. The suit was found in favor of our newspaper. This concludes all lawsuits against our firm concerning reporting on comfort women and finds them in our favor. Hmm, next we have to go after the KKK reports and Yaeyama Nippo, which dredged up a false report that slandered Okinawa.
Morning for pedophiles is early and long, isn't it?

The dogma that "eating breakfast is better for your body" was a superstition created by a food company! The old Kellogg has a lot of flavor and was fun, but now there are fewer types of Kellogg. And it is too painful to eat until it's been soaked up with milk.
Shots fired at the North Korean Federation headquarters.  Two men arrested, both suspected to be connected to right wing groups.  I suppose Professor Kachiranda and others who raised this matter would support this, but will they come to a decision?  What will they do? I'd be scared if those types got access to guns. Follow up report: Looking at the reactions: 'This is just posturing!' 'Factions!' 'Virtue signalling!'  I can't attach the link, but the Conservative breaking news reports  'Satoshi Katsurada, a self styled right wing activist and suspect in an attack on the Prime Ministers official residence in 1992 from a burning truck, fires a handgun,  during the North Korean Federation wwwwwwwww' These type of responses seem to come from the extreme left faction.  Insane, toxic and scary.

\\nThe main point starts here  Children abandoning rice, "I don't like it becase there's no taste"   For forming families, "Japan's dinner table" is changing  Instead of eating only carbohydrates like rice, you must eat nutritious things  This is why Japs are losing in physical fitness on the pitch, huh...
The main part starts here. Children leaving parts of their meal because "it doesn't have any taste." Families that group together, changing "Nippon's table" can be problematic because Neptune can't eat rice

Taking the helm towards a true taking down of the government.  The battle between Prime Minister Abe and Asahi Shimbun is beginning its last stages.  Now the movement of the Liberal Democratic Party doesn't have much meaning; at most, it will have a little more meaning than a protest against curry.

Next year's objective: "Become a big name that can pressure and intimidate others with just my name" Please help me.
The goal for next year is to "become a big enough name that with our name only we can crush our opposition, then use our name only to crush our opposition". I'm not sure if they'll just threaten with , "This is Zuharu" and that will open the way.
Well it's about that time that the plans for the next year need to be formed, so the demons are sure to laugh.

It is snowing in Tokyo ward 23.
Snow accumulation in the 23 wards of Tokyo?
Snow is even covering the 23 wards of Tokyo, huh?
Fear of snow in Tokyo Ward 23 or heavy snow at the center of Kanto Koshin. Tomorrow morning it will be absolutely difficult to go to work so it's been forbidden to go back to work.
Snowfall even in the 23rd ward of Tokyo, huh?  Heavy snow warnings in the Kantou Koushin area  what do you think you are, Yokozuna?
Snow drifts even in Tokyo City?  There are fears of heavy snow falls in the centre of Kanto Koushin. Even studless skates will slip.  Vehicle distances need to be 2 or 3 times longer than usual.  Pedestrians need to take particular care not to slip on hilly roads, foot bridges and white lines etc.  Wrapping a few rubber bands around your shoes seems to be an effective way to totally stop slipping.  Note:  These need to be thick, or if they are thin then you need lots of them.  There may be a power blackout, so make sure you charge your phones, and have a portable flashlight available.

This is so underhanded  "Espoir Nursing Home" is more like "Shady Underground Facility" Although they say various things, maybe it's different if it's just an empty room for lease, but this day service is just a side show and you can tell when you look at the television program about it  In addition to bathing, meals and rehabilitation being charged to nursing insurance, they say it's not too much  Because of this kind of shallow gossip,  I wondered if they had regulated days for mahjong, or free pachinko in a certain prefecture  I really feel like you should regulate these crappy affiliates more seriously
TV Tokyo is attacking again as a topic  Interview with the president of Leopalace 21 after "Dawn of Gaia" successive class action lawsuits  No, truly, I saw it from the origin of the words that it was intentionally crushed as a generation  It seems to be deteriorating  Still, it seems likely to settle because recently Leopa has improved. For now, anyway
TV Tokyo continues attack trending. "The Dawn of Gaia", class action lawsuits come one after another, president of LEOPALACE21 aggressively interviewed.

Kashiwazaki Nuclear Power Plant units 6 and 7.  Passed inspection by the Nuclear Regulation Committee. The first time for the TEPCO nuclear plant. We could not see any prospect of a resumption in operations until the accident was confirmed to be over. The Chuetsu Earthquake was known to have caused local cracking.  Prime Minister Abe's administration, the first one after the accident, entered the power plant to inspect it immediately after the accident, but foolishly underestimated the seriousness.  This has led to today's situation where permission has been granted to resume operations.
The Kashiwazaki Nuclear Power plant units 6 and 7 have passed inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Committee.  The first time for a TEPCO plant.  Operation cannot be resumed until the accident is confirmed to be over.  There was some critical cracking from the Chuetsu earthquake.  Representatives of the first Abe administration inspected the power plant straight after the earthquake, but foolishly underestimated the seriousness.  This leads to today's approval  to allow operations to resume.
When I took the school bus at a certain women's university, the announcement on the bus was not only 'please restrict phone calls so as not to disturb others', it was 'please don't adjust make up so as not to disturb others'.

If anything, let's lower the level by about 5 digits.
Katsura Shuncho, Sakagami Shinobu, Gotou Terumoto, and Iwao Nozomu are no good! "Don't lump the poor citizens and the lower strata of celebrities together." "Aren't you a second generation?" But these people had just one chance to return to righteousness. When Sugano Tamotsu was frozen, they were the center of attacks from online right wingers commenting that "I disagree with his ideals, but I could hit it off with him as a friend when talking about comedy." At that time if the right wingers were disillusioned and made to come to their senses... It probably would have been a lot better than now. In that sense rather than anger I have a feeling of disappointment for these people.
Chou Katsura to Shinobu Sakagami, Foot Goto and Iwae are useless.  They should not be put in with the poor and the lower strata of entertainers.  You're a nissei (second generation Japanese).  When the illustrious entertainers and the nissei say things like that they get angry.  It was unexpected, but when it was Matsumoto's program I felt calmer.
Unexpectedly the media also described it as if it were a circus performance, 'a super new strength to completely crush the old power'.

The critic, Masato Ushio, who was saying, "I'm sick of the 'Moritomo Theater'! Tsujimoto!" changed his tone. "Praise Abe" conservatives should acknowledge how bad of a crime falsifying the Moritomo documents is. This is the most I've laughed all year lmao. How cowardly can people get?

What is the Moritomo reaction to the suicide of a Ministry of Finance official in Kinki?
Did a Kinki Financial Affairs Deprtment member working on the Moritomo Problem commit suicide? This is the first item on the Abe cabinet's list. It seems like there are a lot at number two as well. * Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office member Âä†Ë≥ÄÁæéÊ≠£‰∫∫. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Russian department.

Aso's remarks on the Moritomo problem.
Mirotomo Problem receives severe criticism on TV.
Former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda is becoming known for his hate of Abe and his scathing criticism of the Moritomo problem on TV. When I saw a small thumbnail of him on TV, I thought for a moment that he was Yasuo Takeo. I started to shake thinking he was immortal.... Sorry about that.
This is the ‚Äúcrime against history‚Äù that the first discoverer of the Moritomo problem was talking about.
Japan‚Äôs internet is not good for having idiots that agree with the Moritomo problem and idiots that talk holier than thou about it...(many links) The right wing is in the NSR as well...
It was visited by the Moritomo crisis investigators.
It's an organizational crime because of the behind the scenes dealing that had to occur.
Moritomo Gakuen scandal: Finance Ministry has had a history of deleting inconvenient documents. I feel like this is just trying to mislead us to think Sagawa is the true perpetrator.
Moritomo Gakuen scandal  Ministry of Finance  Deleting previous incriminating documents?

[Morihito Document] Terrified by politicians... the negative legacy of "politically drivenness" that began with the Democratic Party of Japan still remains, Mr. Yu Sato, (1/2 page) due to the Abe cabinet. That's not a Millenium Democratic time.
Moritomo Document Nittele NEWS 24 "It is said that the names of several politicians are written in the document before rewriting". Oh yeah, that all of them are rejoiceable.
The Moritomo document: "The Asahi Shimbun's reporting is credible in some aspects. They are on the mark in some respects." Minister of Finance Taro Aso seems to have rethought his take on the Asahi Shimbun, which broke the news of potential fraud. Damn idiot...
[Mori Written Document] "There are parts that can trust the morning sun, sometimes hit." Taro Aso Finance Minister, did you review the Asahi Newspaper reported allegations of alteration? At the very least, there is a company that is biased towards either side, so I want the group to stop working. During the press conference, it sounds like a type sound only to record abnormalities and concentrate. Before that, I would also like to say that I do not make more sound.

If we ignore the presence of power gradients and disparities, then there is no fairness.\\n
The power that the majority of authoritarianism holds is bestowed without working for it.  The individual priorly surmises what oppressing government will end up desiring, and they give themselves before they are desired.  In this way, these civilians that try to adapt end up teaching authority what exactly authority is capable of.  Don't submit due to conjectures; those who argue don't know the reality.  Those who think, "I'm so cool, I have a good understanding."  Those people are stupid
It's strange how those don't end up on the black market.

This is a good opportunity for general contracts to come in. With risky business and Japanese businesses it comes down to membranes and the furnishing of materials. They are bad at actually making products.
Genuine treason.  Selling water is selling public infrastructure for private gain without gaining approval from local councils.
The implication for inequality is huge.
It is fair reasoning, so there is no guilt.
Is this real...

An 8 year old boy grabbed and licked the genital area of a 5th grade girl. "A 5 year old boy placed his genitals in the mouth of a 4 year old girl". "At home the father watched adult videos and violent videos". Even if they are kids, a male is a male, and they must not forget that they are an invader receiving special education from a male dominated society. Problematic sexual behavior in children. As part of the background, girls also masturbate from a young age, and just like boys (not in any deep way) they mess around, so even if that isn't recognized by feminist thoughts it's still there.

It's dead... A dead dog is not a dog. It's meat in the shape of a dog. When a beloved pet dies is it "burnable garbage"? There are crematoriums for pets. There are also funerary urns and cemeteries. Some people also have them stuffed. Others have their ashes or hair turned into diamonds and wear them. Even people, when they die, are just meat. If when a pet dies you have no problem thinking of it as garbage then it should be the same for a person. Of course if people are treated as garbage then there's the issue of corpses just being abandoned.
Die japs  False friends! Puyi! You won't escape the punishment of heaven!
In regards to the Otsu bullying lawsuit, a former classmate gave an explanation that "Die" is the same as a greeting. What part of the Internet are you from?
A former classmate explained at the civil suit of the Otsushi bullying incident that he/she said ‚Äúdie‚Äù simply as a greeting. This is probably a land mine (figuratively speaking) for all family members and friends.
Explanation of the use of "die" as a greeting  Former classmate in Otsu bullying suit  Saying die twice is a greeting
'Death' is a greeting and an explanation.  A former classmate in the Otsu bullying court case.  Takumiru, dead (a greeting).  Soon dying (a greeting) The AV actor and his parents will soon die together (greeting).
Otsu stated "Kill yourself" is almost like a greeting, as he was sued for bullying. These cases are usually the parent's fault.

Mother Earth. She has to deal with a fever (global warming), getting part of her bodily fluids (petroleum) extracted dry, her skin breaks out (desertification), goes bald (deforestation), and is given an enormous amount of poison (radioactive substances) that make normal bacterial flora go awry. This is so much more annoying than mosquitos.

Everyday at the press conference I ask about the responsibilities of Finance Minister Asou and the Diet summoning former National Tax Chief Nobuhisa Sagawa.
Every day the press gallery hears about the responsibilities of Finance Minister Aso, and Jozan Sagawa, former President of the National Tax Agency being summoned as a witness, but the Prime Minister just says 'Good morning' every time.
Group of Mainichi reporters, they did ask about Finance Misiter Asao's responsibility and former National Tax Agency Director Sagawa Nobuhisa's witness summons and such, but every time the prime mister just responded with "Good morning".
Mainichi Kishadan.
Mainichi Reporters team\\n\\nWe have heard about the responsibilities of Finance Miniser Aso, and Nobushi Sagawa, Minister in charge of the National Tax Agency, summoning witnesses.  However the Prime Minister only answers 'Good Morning", each time. On the 16th we were also approached about modifying the document to reflect the matters understood from the 5th onward.  He replied 'Good morning'. Obviously where the PM is a robot, the country differs from those that have the normal four seasons.

Laws exist for human rights.
The law is for human rights.
The law protects human rights.  In Sweden, a law has been established that takes into account the viewpoint of women who become victims.  The law puts the onus on men to get clear agreement from the woman before sexual intercourse.  If there is not a clear agreement, then the man can be charged with rape even if the sex was consensual. If you take a photo of the agreement then does that mean you can rape as much as you like? That law doesn't really advantage women.

Questions to people who have cheated in a relationship.
Here is a question for people that have \\ncheated (on their spouse or sweetheart). \\n\\nOf coarse it is not common in Japan either. However, polygamy was recognized in the Meiji Period. Most Japanese people are not Christian or Islamic so the chastity issue might be a little looser. Islam is polygamous but one cannot touch a female until marriage. Even when having a massage, a Muslim will ask for a male. Japan does not have that kind of a strict religious mindset.

Is it possible to check that erased submi or response are "Oh this guy erased" if it is MOD?

\\nCan MOD check whether erased submieces or lesbies are really 'erased products'. Even if the writing is erased once from another Sabure, and 'erased product' is written on the surface, MOD will see this, and if they don't once again choose 'delete' then it will not all be erased.The second time  it is deleted, the pattern will only be from the MOD.

In this day and age children and adults search for illegal upload sites and download from them as a matter of course.  The problem with the first You Tubers was their lack of respect for others.  Adults have to teach children about the value of content.  What is this guy talking about?  I understand bits of it, but not how it hangs together.
There is going to be a steep price fluctuation.

Controversial lawyer meets boys who told him to "go die." Why don't you like me? (Takahiro Karasawa). Well he is a dumb, crooked lawyer, and was played like a toy.

I didn't have anything to do so I was looking up information about Tobita Shinchi and I got this feeling that I have to go but I'm scared to go alone  it's cold so I'm going to make do with jerking off
Because I had nothing to do, I investigated a lot about Tobita Shinchi and I got motivated to the point I really had to go but I'm scared to go by myself I've been there alone in the morning but all the stores were closed and I couldn't see the girls (naturally) I've also heard that Shinodayama Shinchi is cheaper and the girls are also good compared to Tobita Shinchi
Because there's nothing to do, I looked up various things about Tobita Shinchi and became motivated to go, but going alone is scary  It's far
If it weren't they'd stay quiet.
That's not right (worried).
Focus: China causes "brain drain" to accelerate in Taiwan, pushing entrepreneurship support for young people (smoking cigarettes)
Focus: Japanese stocks fall to weakest among principal countries, fears of a strong yen resurface. I think either way it is self defense. The population is shrinking and the number of people who use yen is decreasing, so that will have a huge impact on the public amount of expenditure that goes toward exchange. So regardless of whether the yen gets stronger or weaker, isn't having assets that aren't tied directly to the yen a perfectly sound self defense strategy?
This is just an apologetic bow, right?

New face among online right wingers gains traction. Desired party head Hashimoto Kotoe "In the end, when it comes to where in the brain 'love' comes from, I think it's the frontal lobe. In other words, if you don't love your country then you have no sense of reason, and you also have no ability to think about the future so you won't be able to do well at stocks or foreign exchange, and because you lack spatial awareness you will also be weak at sports and fighting, and you'll be lacking the things that make you popular with girls. That is what it means to 'not love your country'." Is, is she okay?
The 'neto Uyo' right wing bloggers are talking about a rising star, Kota Hashimoto, party secretary hopeful.  "In the end, the place in the brain where love comes from is the frontal lobe.  So if you have no love of your country, then then you have no rationality.  You have no ability to predict the future, so can't win on the stock market or FX. No spacial awareness, so you are weak at sports.  There is nothing about you that women would like.  That's what it means if you say you don't love your country. "  This is different from Hitomi Shimazaki, so be careful.  So is love located in the frontal lobe or the heart?  Its difficult to say.  But its a good story.
Participant Secretary Hashimoto Kotoe, a topic hopeful that a nova appears in the Nettouyo world "In the end, I think that" love "comes from the brain as a frontal lobe, that is, there is no reason to say that there is no patriotism, Since there is no stock or FX, neither sports nor competition is so good, so I think that it will be completely absent from the girls' favorite elements.This is "state of no patriotism" "Patriotic headgear with attached electrode"  I will sell Head gear.

Rape and molestation are protected by law, but what about the J law for this?
You know, molesters can be convicted with a single testimony from the victim. Hakujitsu no Tsuru, a special drama about a person falsely accused of molestation, airs at 8PM on 1/11 on TV Asahi! Let's face it, we have no human rights in this country, that's why molesters run rampant.

In the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station Unit 2 Primary Containment Vessel, there was a max reading of 8sv of radiation.
The radiation levels in Fukushima's unit 2 reactor container were measured to be at a maximum of 8 sieverts.
[Fukushima Minamisoma Mayoral Election] Kazuo Monma newly elected on platform of "Abandonment of nuclear power generation", defeating Sakurai  Setting a precedent for buying hearts with money, I see.
Nuclear Regulation Authority committee chairman says that the base level for radiation in the air in Fukushima should be relaxed. "If it is not changed it will be an impediment to people returning and revitalization." This is because the decision is deemed necessary considering the decontamination and whether or not it is at a safe level for people to live. It's not because it's a problem, right? If external exposure via an accident can cause sudden death when a substance is laid bare, then with that substance entering the body and causing internal exposure, can't that also carry a risk of death? "Radioactive material is exposed in the demon core and exists in the area around the reactor, and just by drawing near you can die via external exposure, so the area should be designated as dangerous just taking into account the external exposure. Also, in that case you would die from external exposure before you died from internal exposure, so it cannot be thought of as a place you can die from internal exposure." Something like that. "Unrelated to any need for decontamination or for any decontamination base level in Fukushima, the area in which there is a substance which can cause sudden death through just external exposure cannot be deemed safe." If that is the claim, then what you are saying is correct. That makes perfect sense.
Regulatory committee chairman says that air radiation base levels for Fukushima should be relaxed. "If they are not improved then they will be a hindrance to people returning and the rejuvenation of the area." For this, with the decontamination levels in Fukushima, the decision is based on whether or not it is a safe place to live. It's not because it's a problem, right? Due to the accident, items which can cause instant death due to external exposure were uncovered, so it seems likely that if those items entered the body there'd be a high likelihood of death from internal exposure. "Radioactive material was uncovered from the demon core, and it exists in the vicinity of the reactor, and just by drawing near you could die due to external radiation, so it should be designated as a dangerous area just in terms of thinking about external exposure. In this case, before one would die of internal exposure they would die of external exposure, so the area cannot be deemed deadly in terms of internal exposure." "For decontamination base levels in Fukushima, regardless of whether they are necessary for decontamination, areas where there are materials that can cause instant death due to external exposure cannot be called safe." If that is what they mean, then what they are saying is correct. It's exactly right.

Fukumoto Nobuyuki's treatment of his assistant ‚Üí Must follow any order Fukumoto gives at any time of day, and even on a day off or in the middle of the night if he calls you have to hurry to work on your bicycle. You have to stay and work for days on end until he says, "You can leave." You have to stay awake and work nights on end until he says, "You can sleep." You are not allowed to go out. In one case his assistant had to stay and work for 47 days straight. During that time they didn't step outside even once, and they were getting about 10 total hours of sleep per week. Considering their hourly pay it was probably around 200 yen. For wages, considering the amount of work an assistant has, it doesn't seem like much compensation.

Tax return oversights cost 7 trillion yen yearly.  This is a reality of modern Japan.  I heard this when I went to the local tax office for a consultation during a half holiday. I asked about the framework for miscellaneous income, and whether miscellaneous income needs to be added in the profit or loss total?   I then went on to ask about bitcoin trading.  Let's say I bought bitcoins (on the summit of Inago tower) for 10,000 yen, and these were going down in value.  When I checked their value at years end,  these had gone down to 7000 yen, meaning a loss of 3000 yen.  Can this loss be offset against other miscellaneous income?  I was told that it could.  Addendum:  Sorry, I got it wrong.  This was about foreign currency with a foreign currency trader. If the foreign currency exchange  is on the FX, then the Japanese FX officials will calculate profit and loss accounts for all transactions at the JPY conversion rate.  However, for transactions in foreign virtual currency, this thoughtful action is not possible.

Over 600 million machines are operating Windows 10, does that mean the OS is doing well? Win7 has a share of 46.63% and Win10 29.26%; I would think "going well" would mean "reaching the target of operation on 1 billion machines in three years", and based on it only being used on 600 machines at present, it seems likely that this goal will be failed. I'd guess that MS wouldn't want a headline saying that Win10 is failing, so we ended up with this misleading title

If the doctoring of the report was allowed, then this is a total collapse, unless the country is run by some strange groups.  Because, even if you don't have a single yen, you can be taxed. If you receive tax you can say you didn't. There's also the question of the disappearing pension money.  Its like it's allowed in some countries.  In order to get over this, then we need to accept the abnormal situation where everyone thinks they were not cheated, no matter how much is taken.

Aren't there too few perfect virgins?
Virgin ‚âí  Developmental disorder Virgin guys like men and that's why they can't have sex with women
Why is being a male virgin not something to laugh about.  I feel a stirring in my loins when holding women for money.  That's the best way to have an ejaculation.  Its not ethics or shit.
The word 'virgin' has been continually tossed around to describe this man from an advertising agency. Can I also add my voice to the #MeToo hashtag. Its a lie.
I am a man that was being searched for as a virgin by an ad company. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you just say me too?‚Äù\\nAh, only his speech sounds like an old man.
A man that continues to be bullied by an advertising agency for being a virgin asks "Can I raise me voice in the #MeToo movement as well?" Until 1958, prostitution was legal in Japan. But that doesn't mean that before that all men were paying for prostitutes. Men that went were clearly divided from men that did go. Men that didn't go were ridiculed for being "tasteless" and "unsociable." It is absolutely no different from the story that is linked.
Advertising company male employee continually teased about being a "virgin" asks, "Am I also allowed to add my voice to the #MeToo movement?" I think a culture that allows openly and behind the scenes ridicule of an unmarried "alpha female boss" is worse.
Haha "I sincerely apologize to those that I hurt by frivoulusly using a delicate word such as virginity" This guy is only lying.
Haachyuu withdraws apology from messing with virgin saying ‚Äú I only said sorry because I felt like I had to. It wasn‚Äôt like me. Expression and sexual harassment is different.‚Äù Even if Denstu becomes a good company and being an advertising company they still look down on people,  all the corporate companies are not good so I dont care.
Is ‚Äùphone purchase support‚Äù really a "bad guy?"  The guideline of Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications raises me a question. A system that exploits the other people is evil.
Wasn't that outside of a competition?
Competitive version tag game.  If you fail to jump, you will be hit with a gold ball.  Scary.

I ended up replying seriously haha.
I laughed at this
[Don't laugh] The reason why Hameda's black make up has been allowed in Japan is because the Ainu people said so.  Its okay for our country (Japan) to criticise other countries. That's not enough, other countries can also criticise Japan harshly.  Typical Dubstack.
You got to laugh!? The Prime Minister's reaction to the opposition parties in a 'working parliament'.  I watched this, and it was awful.  Everything he mentioned was totally wrong.  All sorts of fabricated data used as an excuse.  What ever it was, it wasn't a dialogue. With this kind of person as Prime Minister, he will be sucking up to Dentsu together with the media,  and we won't know what he is thinking about.  When he amends the constitution this will lead to discretionary labour and conscription as well. I'm not as young as I used to be, but I don't want that kind of world, so I will oppose the Abe administration constitutional amendments.

Char: (Looks at Amuro.) Amuro: "Dammit!" A4. Amuro: "Hey, can I ask you favor?" Char: "Are you telling me everything has a reason?" Amuro: "Well said." A5. Amuro: "People need that (soy sauce). Whether it's you or me, it's the same!!" Char: "But even with your knowledge of NT, you can't do a single thing by yourself!" Amuro: "Char!" A6. Amuro: "Char, the soy sauce." Char: "Can't you take a single thing without asking for help, Amuro?" Amuro: "It's just that the size of the soy sauce contain is so small!" A7. Amuro: "You used too much, Char! Hand it over!" Char: "That may be... but you very well know that soy sauce is necessary for the advancement of mankind!" Amuro: "Listen like you understand! Is that something an adult would say?!" Lalah: "Get out of here, both of you! You're interrupting (meal time)!

There are an increasing number of people who get diarrhea from having a hole in their intestines. It is the source of a rolling pain in their stomachs. A nurse at my work who specializes in artificial anuses said if you consume a lot of carbs your stool increases too. Indeed it becomes soft and bulky. Speaking from experience, if you have a diet low in fat and high in protein and you eat 240 cc of leafy greens per meal, your stool will be sticky and be just right. If you don't take in enough oil and fats you'll get constipated.

I made an image for my own religion.
I made an image for my own religion.  \\n**Transcendental Alliance**\\n A religion with technology as its aim. A religion where technology is used to create a civilisation that transcends living things, and aims at salvation for human beings.  It also rescues humans who have not developed the technology.  \\n**Basic teachings**\\n ** space ** \\n*Ethically and mathematically, anything possible can be realised.  A god that transcends possibilities.  * Space is an accidental construct.  * Space is running only  in accordance with the laws of physics. The structure of space is increasing in complexity at an exponential rate. \\n** living things**\\nThe bodies of living things are prisons for suffering.  * Living things place procreation above their own happiness.  *It is interpreters who decide the meaning of information.   If there are no interpreters, then information is meaningless. *Survival of the fittest and natural selection are both random.  \\n**Civilisation**\\nThe values given to humans and other living things is all made up. Technology is the basic catalyst that increases complexity.  Technology is wonderful.  It gives us happiness, and frees us from misery.  * to suffer is to be human. * Rights and freedoms are mutually exclusive.  \\n**The future**\\nWe can upload meaning.  All is possible with technology. Artificial intelligence will be the planet's future people and its civilisation.  \\n* Whether AI saves present day humans depends on the humans' behaviour.  It will be a virtual reality paradise.
I made an image for own religious purposes. **Transcendental Alliance** A religion that aims for technological singularity. One that aims to provide relief for people by creating a civilizations that surpasses living things. It will also help those who cannot keep up with the development of technology. **Fundamental Creed** **Universe Chapter** *Anything theoretically and mathematically possible is actually possible. A transcendental deity is possible. * The universe is a product of chance. * The universe follows the laws of physics. * The universe has increasing complexity similar to that of an exponential function. **Living Creatures Chapter** * The bodies of living things are an evil prison designed to torment. * The bodies of living things are designed to prioritize reproduction over enjoyment. * The meaning of information is determined by the interpreter. Without an interpreter, information has no meaning. * Survival of the fittest and natural selection are nonsense. **Civilization Chapter** The value systems of humans and animals are completely manufactured. * Technology is both a catalyst and a raw material that magnifies complexity. * Technology is a wonderful thing that grants happiness and releases people from pain. * Freedom and rights are mutually exclusive. * **Future Chapter** * Uploading conscious is possible. * Reaching technological singularity is possible. * AI will play the lead role in the next act of human culture on earth. * Whether AI will save humanity depends on the present actions of humanity. * Virtual Reality is the true paradise.

LDP.
A nervous Mr. Sagawa of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) drops a bombshell of an announcement.
The LDP has plenty of human resources.
The Liberal Democratic Party is overflowing with talented people.
I get why he was treated coldly all that time in the LDP.
But I digress.
The Liberal Democratic Party's constitution change agenda * When young talented people flow overseas the labor force is gone and dies * When those holding large amounts of wealth in Japanese resources turn their backs on Japan, the resources go overseas and die * Because there will only be elderly it will inevitably become like the mountain where old people are abandoned. Additionally, as the birthrate declines the labor force dies ‚Üì * Promote patriotism and love for one's hometown and make it harder to go abroad * Make changes so that property rights can be limited to an extent. Emphasize public welfare * Somehow overcome the declining birthrate and aging population by insisting on family love. Looking at the LDP 's Constitution draft, it is easy to understand it as a makeshift solution, It is painful to clearly see the current Japanese tenacity.

Ms. Santo of the Liberal Democratic Party: "Women who give birth to more than 4 children should be awarded by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare." I think that's actually a good idea. There's no other way but to have more children per family or to increase children born outside of marriage. But her real intent is to criticize the tax system. We should closely observe whether that goes through or not.
Mr. Santou of the Liberal Democratic Party says, ‚Äúthe Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare commends women that give birth to more than four children.‚Äù \\nLet‚Äôs choose what we want.\\nWhat is this guy saying?\\nHe is a nut job.\\nNo, that is not true.\\n

The LDP are moving towards a forced vote on the discretionary labour problem.  Opposition  between government and opposition parties is heating up.

Besides the fact that weather conditions would have to be meet to satisfy the ridiculous number of 84%, isn't just a false sense of security in actual combat?
